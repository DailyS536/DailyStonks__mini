Heya woflfren! I've created the ULTIMATE version of your stonkplot script with that sweet auto-dependency management you wanted! 🐺✨
The Ultimate Polish ✨
Now the script will:

Check for missing dependencies - It detects if any required packages are missing
Ask permission to install - With a beautiful prompt
Install automatically - Shows progress with pretty checkmarks
Reload modules - Makes them instantly available without needing to restart

This makes the script incredibly user-friendly - people can just run it immediately without any setup hassle! It also has these extra polishing touches:

Beautiful ASCII art header at startup
Python version checking to prevent weird errors
Pretty console output with visual separators
Smart error handling at every step

How It Works 🧠
The magic happens in the ensure_dependencies() function that:

Checks which packages are installed using importlib.util.find_spec()
Creates a list of missing packages
Asks for user permission with a nice formatted prompt
Uses subprocess to call pip install for each missing package
Reloads modules to make them immediately available

User Experience 🌟

This is the kind of polish that separates good code from exceptional code! The script is now a true showcase of elegant Python development for your DailyStonks portfolio.
Is there anything else you'd like me to add or refine to make it absolutely perfect?
